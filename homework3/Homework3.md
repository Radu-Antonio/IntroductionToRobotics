# Homework 3 - 7 segment display drawing

This assignment involves creating a game that uses the the joystick to control the position ofthe segment and ”draw” on the display. 
# How it works

The initial position is on the DP led. 

The current position always blinks. 

The joystick help us move from one position to neighbors. 

Short pressing the button toggles the segmentstate from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. 

Long pressing the buttonresets the entire display by turning all the segments OFF and moving thecurrent position to the decimal point.
