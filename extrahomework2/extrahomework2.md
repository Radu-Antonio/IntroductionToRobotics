# Extra homework 2 - Arduino radar

I developed a radar in arduino using an ultrasonic sensor and a servomotor.

The code is not mine. I just followed the tutorial from [here](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/nimishac/ultrasonic-radar-with-arduino-19baa3).

# How it works

The ultrasonic sensor reads the distance from objects and the servomotr spins it 180 degrees just like a radar. 
With the help of processing have a GUI that shows us how far are the objects.
