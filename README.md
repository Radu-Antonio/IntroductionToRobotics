# Introduction To Robotics ðŸ¤–

In this repository I will be puting all the homeworks from the ***Introduction to Robotics*** course, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. 

In this course we will learn about hardware, electronics, good programing practices and all will be done in **arduino**.
