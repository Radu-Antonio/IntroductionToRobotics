# Homework 2 - Elevator simulator wannabe

This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs and buttons with Arduino.

# How it works

If the elevator is already at the desired floor, pressing the button for that floor would have no effect. 
Otherwise, after a button press, the elevator will move to the corresponding floor. If the elevator is in movement, a button press will do nothing.
